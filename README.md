### 1. Project Title
# Coffee Quality Dashboard:Global Arabica Insights
A dynamic, interactive data visualization tool built to explore CQI coffee quality data — analyzing sensory attributes, processing methods, and defects to reveal their impact on Total Cup Points.

### 2. Purpose
The Coffee Quality Dashboard is a dynamic and interactive Power BI report built to help users explore and analyze over 200 specialty Arabica coffee samples across 9 key sensory attributes — including aroma, acidity, flavor, and body — to reveal their impact on Total Cup Points. This tool is designed for coffee producers, quality analysts, and data enthusiasts seeking to uncover trends and insights in global coffee quality.

### 3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
⦁	**Power BI Desktop** – Main data visualization used for report creation and dashboard design.
⦁	**Power Query** – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping, filter  and preparing raw data.
⦁	**DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Used for creating calculated measures, dynamic visuals and conditional logic.
⦁	**Microsoft Excel** – initial data preparation and exploratory analysis
⦁	**GitHub** – for version control and project sharing.
⦁	**File Format** - .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

### 4. Data Source
The dataset includes ~200 Arabica coffee samples stored in a single flat table provided by the Institute. Key columns include: Total Cup Points, Aroma, Acidity, Flavor, Harvest Year, Country, Region, Varity, Method and other sensory attributes.The data covers harvest years from 2010 to 2018.

### 5. Features/Highlights
The best dashboard explanation format:

**a. Business problem**
Specialty coffee producers and quality analysts need to identify which sensory attributes, processing methods, and defect patterns most influence Total Cup Points to improve quality and market competitiveness.
**b. Key Questions**
a. Which processing method scores highest?
b. How does harvest year affect quality?
c. Which sensory attributes matter most?
d. Top countries by average score?
**c. Goal of the dashboard**
To visually explore ~200 Arabica coffee samples by analyzing sensory scores, processing methods, and defects, and understand their relationship to Total Cup Points.
**d. Key Visuals – Brief Walkthrough**  
✅ Overview Page
⦁	Summary cards: Quick KPIs showing average Total Cup Points, total defects, number of countries, and top scoring processing method — to set the context.
⦁	Scatter plots: Show how Flavor, Aftertaste, and Acidity relate to Total Cup Points, highlighting the strongest sensory drivers of quality.
⦁	Map: Visualizes Total Cup Points by country, making it easy to spot top-performing origins.
⦁	Average sensory scores bar chart: Compares overall scores across different attributes (Aroma, Body, Balance, etc.) to see which are strongest.
✅ Total Cup Points Page
⦁	Bar charts by Country, Region, Variety, Processing Method, and Harvest Year: Break down Total Cup Points to see where and why scores vary.
⦁	Altitude chart: Shows how altitude affects quality, revealing that higher altitudes often correlate with better cup scores.
✅ Sensory Attributes Page
⦁	Grouped bar charts: Compare sums of Sweetness, Flavor, and Aroma across countries, regions, varieties, and processing methods.
⦁	Helps discover patterns, like which origins and methods deliver higher sensory scores.
✅ Defects Page
⦁	Summary cards: Total Category One and Two defects.
⦁	Average defects by country and quaker counts: Identify countries with higher defect levels.
⦁	Decomposition Tree: Tracks Total Cup Points flowing across country, region, processing method, method style, moisture percent, and harvest year — to see where scores concentrate or drop.

### 6. Business Impact and Insights
⦁	Quality Optimization: Producers can pinpoint which sensory attributes most impact cup scores and refine processing to boost quality.
⦁	Market Positioning: Exporters can highlight top-performing lots by country, variety, or method to target specialty buyers.
⦁	Defect Reduction: Identify defect patterns by origin and processing to proactively reduce defects and improve overall scores.
⦁	Strategic Sourcing: Buyers can spot regions and harvest years consistently delivering higher quality, guiding purchasing decisions.
